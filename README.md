## Data Sources

The datasets included in this repository are sourced from the [City of Windsor Open Data Catalogue](https://opendata.citywindsor.ca/). They provide a wide range of information about the city, including election results, precipitation data, yard waste service requests, land parcels, etc.

## Data Cleaning Scripts

We have provided simple Python scripts to assist in cleaning and preprocessing the datasets. The usage of these scripts depends on the specific dataset being worked with.

## RSS Feed Reader

We have developed a Go-based RSS feed reader that retrieves the latest updates from the City of Windsor's open data catalogue feed. It automatically organizes the content and ensures the datasets in this repository are up to date. The reader runs once a week automatically, and on all changes to the main branch.
